### [DEPRECATED]zsh-autosuggestions-conf

##### This project is **deprecated**, because zsh-autosuggestions now support oh-my-zsh plugin natively.

config oh-my-zsh to use [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/tarruda/zsh-autosuggestions.git)

**Note**: make sure `zsh-autosuggestions` is loaded before this plugin
